This code is provided to facilitate replication and for documentation. It includes several hardcoded paths used during the experiments.

## Model
A fine-tuned model is available at on Huggingface: [rad_small](lrei/rad-small).

```python
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model="lrei/rad-small")

# Simple high-level usage
pipe(["The patient suffer from a complex genetic disorder.", "The patient suffers from a common genetic disorder."])
```

## Dataset

The dataset used to train this model is available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13882003).
It is a subset of abstracts obtained from PubMed and sorted into the 3 classes on the basis of their MeSH terms.

Like the model, the dataset is provided for demonstration and methodology validation purposes. The original PubMed data was randomly under-sampled.
